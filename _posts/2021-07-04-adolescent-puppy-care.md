**By the seventh month, your puppy is most definitely an adolescent... and he's a force to be reckoned with!**

**From now until he's a year old (or, if he's a large/giant breed, until he's 2 years or more) his growth slows down pretty significantly.**

Big breeds have more growing and maturing to do than the smaller ones, but even they take their foot off the gas a bit.

So, what does change during the second six months of your pup's life? Actually quite a lot!

If you're the parent of a human teenager (s) you'll have a fairly good idea of what's to come.

**If you haven't had that pleasure yet, here's a quick list of what to expect:**

- challenging authority
- testing limits
- sexually motivated behavior
- pushy/bossy behavior
- the pursuit of independence
- attempts to ignore house rules (or you)

You get the picture! But it's not all hard work and worry.

Your little pup is now a big pup, but he's still your best friend and he still needs you to take care of and guide him.

If you've been diligent about training and socialization up until now you've already set the foundation for good adult behavior.

**Like most teens, your pup will 'forget' a lot of what he's learned up to now, at least for a few months, but once he's safely past the worst of adolescence that sweet, well-behaved boy you used to know will return safe and sound.**

So, let's take a closer look at the interesting, challenging and fun (yes, fun) months that make up your puppy's adolescence...

## Your Puppy's Development & Growth - Months 7 thru 12
**There aren't really any scientific terms to describe the second six months of your little Rascal's life, 'adolescence' pretty much sums it up.**

By the beginning of this developmental period **small to medium breed puppies will likely have reached their full height, and simply be gaining weight as they head towards physical maturity.**

They're also sexually mature.

**Large and giant breed puppies probably look like teenagers, but may act more like toddlers!**

They will still be gaining both height and weight, and although they're approaching sexual maturity they won't actually get there until they're 8 or 9 months old.

That's the time when you need to set up an appointment to spay or neuter your big pup, if it hasn't been taken care of already.

Most large breeds won't be physically mature by the end of the first twelve months, for some it can take two years or even longer. For these guys the teenage years tend to last a l-o-n-g time.

**Although they're not quite so excited about, or committed to, their lessons during this stage, adolescent pups are still very impressionable and can learn quickly.**

Their attention span is longer and they can understand more complex commands, the only problem is that often they don't want to do as they're told, and they can be stubborn and ornery at times.

**By the beginning of this stage most pups are very reliable about their house training and won't pee or poop indoors, or in their crate, when left alone (for reasonable lengths of time).**

But not *all* puppies have got it sussed out yet. Some may still have 'accidents' (especially if you originally paper-trained them and now expect them to do their business outside).

Small breeds tend to have more issues with this than the larger ones.

Just be patient and calm. Before the end of this period your pup's elimination habits will be all sorted out, as long as you've followed the guidelines I've described and been consistent in your teaching.
