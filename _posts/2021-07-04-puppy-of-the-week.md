**By the seventh month, your puppy is most definitely an adolescent... and he's a force to be reckoned with!**

**From now until he's a year old (or, if he's a large/giant breed, until he's 2 years or more) his growth slows down pretty significantly.**

Big breeds have more growing and maturing to do than the smaller ones, but even they take their foot off the gas a bit.

So, what does change during the second six months of your pup's life? Actually quite a lot!

If you're the parent of a human teenager (s) you'll have a fairly good idea of what's to come.

**If you haven't had that pleasure yet, here's a quick list of what to expect:**

- challenging authority
- testing limits
- sexually motivated behavior
- pushy/bossy behavior
- the pursuit of independence
- attempts to ignore house rules (or you)
You get the picture! But it's not all hard work and worry.

Your little pup is now a big pup, but he's still your best friend and he still needs you to take care of and guide him.

If you've been diligent about training and socialization up until now you've already set the foundation for good adult behavior.

**Like most teens, your pup will 'forget' a lot of what he's learned up to now, at least for a few months, but once he's safely past the worst of adolescence that sweet, well-behaved boy you used to know will return safe and sound.**

So, let's take a closer look at the interesting, challenging and fun (yes, fun) months that make up your puppy's adolescence...
