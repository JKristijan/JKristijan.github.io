subtitle: Here's a not so short text containing the highlights of my life

My name is Kristijan Angjelkoski and I am a professional QA Game Tester and student at the [Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en) of Skopje.

### Middle School

I started my life in the [Dane Krapchev](https://oudanekrapcev.edu.mk) middle school where I got familiar with the amazing feeling of being part of an orchestra. My orchestra days started with the mandolin which *wasn't* my first choice. After a short debate with the conductor I started playing the guitar. This almost lasted till the end of middle school. (more about that later) 

Nothing of note happened for me until 9th grade. Back in 2015/16 before I finished middle school, I decided to enroll in an annual Balkan literary festival held in Koƒço Racin's honor in his hometown, Veles. Here, being the aspiring artist that I was, I submitted a drawing of Racin's house that took a week and a half and more than 20 hours of work to complete. Even the art teacher was amazed at the level of detail I went into. At the end, all of the hard work was worth it because I managed to win first place and got my art showcased at the galery. 

To finish off my middle school days, we were supposed to do a concert with our orchestra. Unfortunately, our bass player refused to show up at the practice sessions leading up to it. Due to the fact that he was one of my closer friends, I had spent quite some time playing the double bass in my spare time, so I offered to try and cover for him at the practice sessions. The conductor noticed this and thought that I should seriously consider changing my role to be the sole bass player of the orchestra. This happened not two full weeks before the concert. After the concert was done and I had played the bass insted of the guitar, the conducter never really let me switch back to guitar. To this day I'm thankful that he didn't because playing bass is the best thing that happened to me.

### High School

All of my life I had a passion for demolishing electronics in my attempts to "repair" it. So there was no better choice than for me to enroll in [SUGS Vlado Tasevski](http://www.sugsvladotasevski.edu.mk/web/). Only two important things happened for me in high school. The first one was a [JA Macedonia](http://jamacedonia.mk/web/) business competition, and the second one was a national competition between all of the high school seniors in Macedonia. 

Its hard to know that once you were way ahead of your time but you gave up on your dreams because of people's judgement. In what I remember as the 2017 JA Macedonia business competition, my team pitched an idea for an online study program for individuals with disabilities. 

The first major setback that we encountered was time. Other teams knew a month in advance about the competition. Our school informed us one week before the competition. This made everything that was made to end up rushed and halfbaked. The whole idea was to create an online platform in colaboration with faculties and schools of our nation where individuals with disabilities could go to for help with school materials. Not everyone can understand everything about a subject in the 45 minutes that the teachers had to present it to us. So this platform aimed to give everyone that was struggling with learning the material at school, an at home source. All of the videos and materials uploaded to the site would have been made by fellow senior students. Everything would go through a proffesor for approval so that everyone could rest assured that the material was high quality and relevant to the subject. 

To generate money for improving the platform and keeping it afloat we aimed to put short 5 second ads on the videos. While presenting this idea to the jury they deemed it as "a simple school project". The company was named [Seekers](https://seekerservices.weebly.com), because we couldn't think of a better name and it was the least important part of everything in the moment. Everything in the site had issues and barely worked due to us rushing to meet the deadline. Even the credits show two people before you click on them. Couple of years after this happened the whole world was in need of an online schools. Our country would have had its own personalised one if only it decided to invest in it.
