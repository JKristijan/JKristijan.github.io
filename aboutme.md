Hello stalker! My name is Kristijan Angjelkoski, but you can call me Kris. I have nothing interesting to tell you so I'll give you [something interesting] to listen to.
What else do you need?

### My story
I grew up in [Skopje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje). The most interesting thing about me is that I'm a part of an orchestra. Got introduced to it in [Dane Krapchev](https://oudanekrapcev.edu.mk), where I spent most of my life as a middle schooler. Started off with a mandolin and a month or two after that I promptly changed to a guitar. In the orchestra I had a neighborhood friend which played on the double bass. During the breaks I would often play around with it because I really liked the sound that came out of it. The bassist had a bad habit of being late to practice. This was especially bad because he was the only bassist we had. More often than not I would cover for him just so we could start playing. One day, the teacher just said to me: "From today onwards you have no reason to continue playing the guitar. *You* will be our new bassist." It has been 8 years since then and I am still the lead bassist. We went from small school talent shows to representing our country on many occasions in different countries across Europe. The most notable one that we had was the one that was held in the [St. Stephen's Basilica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen%27s_Basilica) chapel.
